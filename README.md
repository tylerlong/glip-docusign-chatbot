# Glip DocuSign Chatbot

What does it do? It assumes that a company uses both Glip and DocuSign.

Whenever DocuSign sends an email to an employee to ask him/her to sign a document, a Glip message will also be sent to the same employee.

He/She could click the link in the Glip message and sign the document.
